   `----'

Welcome to my code café — a cozy corner where I explore Python, test ideas, and learn with the help of AI.

## 🧠 What's Brewing

This is not a polished portfolio. It’s a digital napkin full of:
- 🧪 Code experiments and AI-assisted snippets
- 📝 Notes on what I tried, what confused me, and what might be genius (or not)
- 🤖 Scripts that started with a question and ended with… something
- 🐍 Python, mostly. But who knows what else might sneak in?

## 💬 Disclaimer

I'm just the idea guy. The code? That’s mostly AI magic.  
If it’s messy, confusing, or broken — talk to the robot 🤖

## 🪄 Why This Exists

Sometimes I write code and forget why. This café is my way of keeping track — with comments, notes, and a little storytelling.  
If you’re browsing, feel free to grab a virtual seat and explore.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

Some of the code in this repo was downloaded from generous developers who shared their work online.  
I’m not claiming credit — just collecting cool ideas in one place so I can learn from them.  

If you recognize your code and want credit, a shoutout, or removal, feel free to reach out.  
This café runs on curiosity, caffeine, and community ☕💻
