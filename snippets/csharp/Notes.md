# ☕ C# Corner at Đức and AI Code Café

This folder contains my C# experiments — some written by me, most brewed with AI help.

## 🧪 What's Inside

- `async_test.cs`: Trying to understand async/await and Task behavior.
- `string_magic.cs`: Playing with string manipulation and interpolation.
- More to come as I explore and ask AI for help.

## 💬 Disclaimer

I don’t always know what this code does. I just ask questions, point at ideas, and let the AI cook.  
If it’s broken, confusing, or brilliant — talk to the robot 🤖

## 🪄 Why C#?

Because curiosity doesn’t care about language.  
Sometimes Python feels like tea, and C# feels like espresso.
